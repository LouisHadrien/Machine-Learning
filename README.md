# Machine-Learning

This fold contains two kaggle competitions: the titanic problem and a cuisine classification project

#Titanic
This is a kaggle competition (the dataset can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
The goal of the project is to predict whose passengers survived the disaster.
Feature engineering transform the raw data into acceptable data for the training of the models (dealing with missing values, feature engineering and creation of dummy variables)
Model building contains all the models trained and optimized using different classifiers.


# What is cooking
This is a kaggle competition (). From a dataset containing cooking receipes(list of ingredients) and a label (cuisine), predict
